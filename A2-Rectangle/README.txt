1. Input a non-negative integer to generate boxes
2. The program then will output the oclusion angle







Thoughts & Planning
1. Image bounds will be 400x400?
1. Generate circles first
    1.1. Generate a random numbers for the x & y positions

2. For generating the box
    2.1 Generate 2 random points.
    2.2 Find the slope of the line
    2.3 Find the slope of a perpendicular line
    2.4 Pick a random point on that perp line
    2.5 Get the distance of the first line, use that to make the second (with the same slope)
